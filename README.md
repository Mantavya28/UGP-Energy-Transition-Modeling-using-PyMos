# UGP - Energy Transition Modeling using PyMos
Under Prof. Swathi Battula, Department of Electrical Engineering  

• Develop an Energy Transition Model  using PyMos library to minimize the electricity generation cost.  
• Reduced grid dependence by integrating renewable sources like Solar Energy with Battery storage facility.
• Explored multi-objective optimization to minimize both electricity generation costs and the carbon footprint.  
• Estimated the optimal capacity for the Solar Power Plant incorporating constraints for peak demand & generation.
